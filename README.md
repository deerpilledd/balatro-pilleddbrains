# balatro-pilleddbrains
A side project that I am currently working on. Making my own Balatro mod... I don't have ANY prior coding experience.. so this will be a WILD ride.

This is also my first time using GitHub, so I also don't know what I'm doing here either. This is all a learning experience for me.

1/50 Jokers added, there are 4/50 that are conceptualized (Concepts also count already added/completed Jokers) 
I don't know if anyone really is gonna check here, other than my discord webhooks but feel free to contact me to suggest something.
I like GitHub so far, I am also trying to migrate to the desktop app and it's a bit confusing currently but I should be able to adapt to it.

Does anyone know how to fix Medusa not triggering the first stone card when it becomes a stone card?
